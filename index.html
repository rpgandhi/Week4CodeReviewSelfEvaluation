    <p>What are my weaknesses? What things require more work in order to be a better developer? What tings are necessary so that I can have the best chances of getting a job come March? These are the questions I have been tasked with asking myself today and, frankly, I am quite surprised. I was expecting to spend the day coding, as per usual for Friday projects. I certainly did not expect a day of introspection. But here goes...

    The funny thing is, I am a very introspective person to begin with. I am always in my own head and space, evaluating myself and those around me. So it is without much thinking or hesitation that I can quite quickly and easily identify not just one, but two things that I would like to become better at. Those two things are:

    Time management
    Meeting people/networking

    Lina, you may recall once in Intro when I told you I was extremely shy. This is absolutely true. I have a very hard time breaking out of my shell and really putting myself out there. I can make friends, sure, and have several wonderful friends that I've made in the program, but you don't see me fluttering around effortlessly talking to everyone. That's just not who I am. That's just not HOW I am. The thought of mixing and mingling with people that I don't feel comfortable with is almost physically paingful. Go figure then that I've aspired to jump into a career where networking is EVERYTHING - so I hear.

    I would like, scratch that, LOVE to be able to really put myself out there, meet people, network, the way I see so many people do. But when you're born shy and you've been shy your whole life, what can you do? This seems like a good time to take some time to really ponder this question.

    So... the research commences.
